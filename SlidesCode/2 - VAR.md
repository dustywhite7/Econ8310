# What is a VAR model?

VAR models are a more structural way that we can model time series data.

- VAR: **V**ector **A**uto**R**egressive model
- Makes use of multiple correlated time series
- Based on SUR (Seemingly Unrelated Regressions) models

---

# Quick Overview of SUR models

<br>

Consider $j$ regression equations:

$$ Y_{j} = X_j\beta_j + \epsilon_j $$

where $Y_j$, and $\epsilon_j$ are $N \times 1$, $X_j$ is $N \times K$,  and $\beta_j$ is $K \times 1$


---

# Quick Overview of SUR models


Consider $j$ regression equations:

$$ Y_{j} = X_j\beta_j + \epsilon_j $$

Imagine that the outcomes $Y_{ij}$ are correlated such that 
$$ Cov(\epsilon_{ij}, \epsilon_{ik})=\sigma_{ij}$$
and 
$$ Cov(\epsilon_{ij}, \epsilon_{i'k})=0, \;\;\forall \;i \neq i'$$

---

# Quick Overview of SUR models

We can stack our $J$ regressions to get a single system of equations:

$$ \begin{bmatrix} Y_1 \\ Y_2 \\ \vdots \\ Y_{J}\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} X & \mathbf{0} & ... & \mathbf{0}  \\ \mathbf{0} & X & ... & \mathbf{0}  \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{0} & X  \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \\ \vdots \\ \beta_{J\times K}\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_1 \\ \epsilon_2 \\ \vdots \\ \epsilon_{J\times K}\end{bmatrix}$$

Where $Y_j$ is a vector of length $N$, and $X$ is an $N \times K$ matrix

---

# Quick Overview of SUR models

Then the FGLS estimator of the system is 

$$ \hat{\beta}_{FGLS} = \left( X'\left(\hat{\Sigma} \otimes I_J\right)X  \right)^{-1} X'\left(\hat{\Sigma} \otimes I_J\right)Y $$

<br>

Where $\hat{\Sigma} = [\hat{\sigma}_{ij}]$, and

$$ \hat{\sigma}_{ij} = \frac{1}{N}\left(y_i - X_i\beta_i\right)'\left(y_j - X_j\beta_j\right) $$


---

# Quick Overview of SUR models

So what does all this mean?
- SUR models relax the assumption that each regression is uncorrelated with the others
	- No longer modeling a bunch of separate time series
- Allows us to use some of our dependent variables in the $X$ matrices for other regressions
	- Allow us to model simultaneous time series, where the errors across the series will be correlated


---

# VAR Models

Just a SUR model where the multiple dependent variables are time series
- We can include lags of dependent variables as part of the $X$ matrix of covariates
- VAR models are built to capture the interactions between variables as time passes

---

# VAR Models

<br>

We can write the VAR model

$$ \mathbf{y}_{i,t} = \mathbf{\mu_i} + \mathbf{\Gamma}_{i,1} \mathbf{y}_{i,t-1} + \sum_{j=1}^{J}\mathbf{\Gamma}_{j,1} \mathbf{y}_{i, t-1} + \mathbf{\epsilon}_{i,t} $$ 

where $i \neq j$

Representing the $i$th equation relating lagged dependent variables to the dependent variable in time $t$.

# Implementing a VAR Model

```python
# Getting started by importing modules and data
import pandas as pd, numpy as np
from statsmodels.tsa.api import VAR
import statsmodels.tsa.stattools as st
import plotly.express as px
from datetime import datetime

# Collect data, set index
# Be sure to put the URL back onto a single line!!
data = pd.read_csv("https://github.com/dustywhite7/Econ8310/
raw/master/DataSets/pollutionBeijing.csv")
# Difference and log dep. var.
format = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
data['datetime'] = pd.to_datetime(data['datetime'], 
	format=format)
data.set_index(pd.DatetimeIndex(data['datetime']), 
	inplace=True)
```

---


# Implementing a VAR Model

```python
# Select variables for VAR model
varData = data[['pm2.5','TEMP','PRES',
			'Iws']].dropna()[:-50]
```
<br>

- **REMEMBER: We need ALL stationary variables**
	- `st.adfuller` is the test to use on each variable
- We also need the terminal (or starting) values of each variable PRIOR to differencing to reconstruct the original time series

---


# Implementing a VAR Model

```python
model = VAR(varData) # define the model and data
model.select_order() # uses information criteria to
		     # select the model order
modelFit = model.fit(30) 
		# order chosen based on BIC criterion
```

- Diagnostics like those from the ARIMA(p,d,q) models are not available to determine our model order
- Use information criteria to find the optimal order of the VAR model

---

# Forecasting with a VAR Model

```python
# Forecasting
pred = modelFit.forecast(varData['2013-01-04':].values, 
			steps = 50)
```

- When using a trained VAR model, we must include enough observations from our dataset in order to provide the expected number of lags to the model
- The more lags we include in the model (the higher the model order), the more observations we need before we can fit the model to the data


---

# Forecasting with a VAR Model

Recall that our raw forecast is not always what we will observe in the real world
- If we have **differenced** our data to achieve stationarity, we need to undo that differencing in our model's forecasts


<!-- ---

# Forecasting with a VAR Model

```python
def dediff(todaysVal, forecast):
    future = forecast
    for i in range(np.shape(forecast)[0]):
        if (i==0):
            future[i] = todaysVal + forecast[0]
        else:
            future[i] = future[i-1] + forecast[i]
            
    return future
```

- Use a function like this one to generate predicted values that can be applied to the original series (only if your data had to be differenced) -->


---

# Forecasting with a VAR Model

```python 
# Make predictions a DataFrame
nextPer = pd.DataFrame(pred,
                # Use the index from the last 50 observations
                #   as the index for the predictions
            	pd.DatetimeIndex(
                varData.iloc[-50:].index),
                columns=varData.columns)

# Isolate the testing data, last 50 periods
test = data.iloc[-50:]
```
<br>

Here, we transform our predictions (and truth) into datetime formatted values, so that we can more easily plot them.

---

# Forecasting with a VAR Model

```python 
# Create and format the figure
fig = px.line(x = nextPer.index, 
		y=[nextPer['pm2.5'], test['pm2.5']],
		labels = {
			'value' : 'Particulate Matter',
			'x' : 'Date',
			'variable' : 'Series'
		})

# Renaming the series
fig.data[0].name = "Forecast"
fig.data[1].name = "Truth"

# Render the plot
fig.show()
```

Plotting prediction vs truth

# Forecasting Observations

<br>

- Repeated Forecasts are needed when data is updated
- Forecasts are not accurate far into the future
- They DO, however, manage to move in the right direction pre-emptively! (A bigger deal than it sounds)

# Impulse Response Functions

<br>

- VAR Models can show us how each variable responds to a shock in our system
- Frequently used to determine impact of policy changes or economic shocks in macroeconomic models
- Give us insight into how our VAR model perceives the relationship between parameters over time

---

# Impulse Response Functions

```python
irf = modelFit.irf(10) # 10-period Impulse Response Fn
irf.plot(impulse = 'Iws') # Plot volume change impact
irf.plot_cum_effects(impulse = 'Iws') # Plot effects
```

- Generate a 10-period Impulse Response Function (IRF)
- Focus on plotting the effect of changes in trade volume on all variables (over 10 periods)
- Plot the cumulative effect over 10 periods

# VARMAX

We can extend our model by adding exogenous variables into the mix, as well as Moving Average terms (shocks based on last period's errors). 

Using the Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (VARMAX) model, this is straightforward

---

# VARMAX

```python
# Prep our data
columns = ['pm2.5','TEMP','PRES','Iws', 'DEWP']
varData = data[columns].dropna()[-500:-50]
exog = varData['DEWP']
varData.drop('DEWP', axis=1, inplace=True)

# Create and fit model
model = sm.tsa.VARMAX(endog = varData.values, 
	exog=exog.values, 
	order=(10,0)) # define the order here for VARMAX!
modelFit = model.fit() 
modelFit.summary()
```

---

# VARMAX

This is a pretty robust time series model! We can explore many facets of our time series, as well as the interconnected system of variables that define local weather (or other systems), and generate figures to explain these relationships to stakeholders.

<!-- 
---

# Saving Models

We can use ``` pickle``` functions to store our models to disk, and utilize them later.

```python
import cPickle as pkl

filename = 'myModel.pkl' #string of file name/location
output = open(filename, 'wb') # allow python to write
pkl.dump(modelFit, output) # stores the reg object @ filename
output.close() # terminate write process
```

In this way, we can store just about any object in Python, although we have to take care with how large some objects (or models) may be.

---

# Restoring Models

<br>

```python
reg = pkl.load(open('myModel.pkl', 'rb'))
```

When you are ready to access your model or data again, you can load your pickle back into memory.

- Forecast from same model on different days
- Share models with co-workers
- Just need to make sure to import libraries first! -->
